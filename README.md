# The Kitchen

This is where I keep Chef cookbooks that I've developed, or made changes to. If you want actual food recipes then http://www.hubbub.co.uk/in-your-area/1/recipes is the place you want.

Each cookbook is on it's own branch, allowing me to track them individually. See http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Headless+Branches+for+Cookbook+Repositories for details.
