= DEPRECATED:

This repo is no longer the recommended cookbook to use for installing and maintaining node and npm. The 'nodejs' cookbook here would be the one to use: https://github.com/redguide/nodejs/

= DESCRIPTION:

This cookbook will deploy node and npm (node package manager) to your system. It also defines providers to install/uninstall node module and start/stop/restart node servers.

* homepage : https://github.com/digitalbutter/cookbook-node

= REQUIREMENTS:

* a working git framework (for example provided by Opscode git cookbook)

Tested on ubuntu. Should work on other system with upstart.

= ATTRIBUTES:

* node/revision : indicates which revision to install. Default is the latest ('HEAD'). Since node evolves very quickly and is not always that stable, you might want to set it to a stable version (for example 'v0.4.3')

* `node[:node][:packages]` - An array of npm packages to be installed globally

= USAGE:

Include the node recipe to download, compile and install node along with npm.

Optionally, you can add NPM packages by creating a packages array:

```
default_attributes({
  node: {
    packages: ['coffee-script', 'lineman']
  }
})
```

== defines:

+node_server+ provider to start/stop server. The following example will start a provided script with node. Logs can be found in /var/log/node-my_node_server.log.

    node_server "my_node_server" do
        script "/path/to/your/node/script.js" # mandatory
        user "my_user" # default : nodejs
        dependency ["required","node","modules"] # default []. Will be installed with npm before starting the server
        args "arguments for your script" # default ""
        init_style :runit # default - by platform. Spported values: :upstart, :init, :runit
        action :start # Will start a node server. In [stop,start,restart], default :start
    end

+node_npm+ provider to manage nodejs modules. The following example will install the connect module for node.

    node_npm "connect" do
        action :install
    end
